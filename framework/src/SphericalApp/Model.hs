module SphericalApp.Model where
{-| SphericalApp Model

Defines the Model, which is the combination of _data_ and _contractors_
which are sufficient to determine the next event in a particle history.

The Model's data is a mesh, a time-step value and an array, indexed by
the mesh's cell indices, of Material data. The Material data, in tern,
contains an absorption and scattering opacity.

The contractors are functions which compute the particle's streaming
distance to various events, such as mesh boundaries, end of time-step,
and material interactions, _and_ the result of this interaction.

These contractors are then provided to the MC module, which will
evaluate them, compare the results, and continue the iteration.

-- * Converters from mesh crossings to Events

-- Do I need mesh crossing events which are distinct from the mesh
-- neighbor types?
--
-- Face means the same thing in both contexts.
--
-- There may be more than one kind of Boundary. E.g. physical versus
-- computational domain. The latter would probably just be tallied as
-- a face crossing. If a physical boundary is not Escape, what could it be?
--
-- Self might mean more than Reflect. E.g. hitting the origin in
-- Spherical coordaintes and still being in cell 0. Although, this
-- could be considered a kind of reflection.
--
-- It appears that Events are different than the mesh's neighbor
-- relationships, but in this model, they look very much alike.

-- You can argue that the tally should record _exactly_ the events
-- which occur in the course of the simulation. Conversion to other
-- quantities should happen in post-processing. This would mean
-- refining the neighbor kinds to discriminate between all events
