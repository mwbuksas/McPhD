module Space.Spherical1D where
{-| Spherical 1D space is for problems with the rotational symmetry of
the sphere. The only location information we need in this space is the
distance from the origin, and a direction of motion measured from the
radial outward vector.

                                    /| dir_vec = <\xi, \eta>

We can also assume, without loss of generality, that \eta >= 0, since
other eta values can be obtained via rotation.

The equations of motion in this coordinate system are most naturally
expressed in terms of r^2, r\xi and r\eta:

  r\xi  <- r\xi + d
  r\eta <- r\eta
  r^2   <- r^2 + 2dr\xi + d^2

where dir_vec = <\xi, \eta>.

Because r^2 = (r\xi)^2 + (r\eta)^2, we drop it as seperate quantity,
and just store <r\xi, r\eta> as a regular Vector2.
